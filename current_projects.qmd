## Conservation Genetics, Species Delimitation, and Biogeography of North American Pitcher Plants in the *Sarracenia rubra* species complex

**Southeastern Center for Conservation / Atlanta Botanical Garden**

*Supervisors: Dr. Lauren Eserman-Campbell, Amanda Carmichael*

As a current NSF RaMP Trainee, I am studying species delimitation in the *Sarracenia rubra* species complex, an taxonomically unresolved group of North American pitcher plants. This group includes three federally-listed Endangered taxa and two subspecies petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. I am isolating DNA from plants in ABG's conservation safeguarding collection and local herbaria, then using whole genome sequencing to study phylogenomic relationships in this species complex.

In addition to my phylogenomic work, I am using ecological niche models to assess patterns of niche overlap and climate vulnerability in two imperiled, narrowly-sympatric montane *Sarracenia*.

## Natural History and Conservation of American Starvine (*Schisandra glabra*)

**Dept. of Environmental Sciences / Emory University**

*Advisors: Carl Brown, Kirk Hines HTR*

I am currently working with staff at Emory University and AG Rhodes to digitize a seven-year phenology dataset for American Starvine (*Schisandra glabra*), an imperiled vine native to the Southeastern US and Hidalgo, Mexico. In addition, I have previously mapped known populations at a field site and developed habitat suitability models for a technical report for resource managers.
