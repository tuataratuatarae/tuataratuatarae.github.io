My name is Nick and I'm an undergrad studying Environmental Sciences at Emory University! I am broadly interested in ecology, biogeography and conservation biology, and while I am open to work in a variety of ecosystems, I have the most experience working in forests, freshwater streams, and coastal areas. I'm super stoked about amphibians, reptiles, plants, and aquatic invertebrates, but I have been gradually expanding my horizons into different taxa (big fan of woodpeckers these days). Though I have probably been on the ecology career trajectory since elementary school, I did make a few forays into the world of Latin and Roman history in middle/high school, and was nearly a Classics minor as an undergrad. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy hiking, camping, climbing, and photographing salamanders and wildflowers. I've also been making a lot of maps for fun lately. I have a 1400+ day streak on Duolingo and enjoy the NYT Mini Crossword. I'm also a huge fan of the KY-based band [Bendigo Fletcher](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6O8lpJl2nITlA3dJfT95pM?si=lXcUN4DST6KeZN1xoJ-E4Q).
