My name is Nick and I'm an undergrad studying Environmental Sciences at Emory University! I am broadly interested in ecology, biogeography and conservation biology, and while I am open to work in a variety of ecosystems, I have the most experience working in forests, freshwater streams, and coastal areas. I'm super stoked about amphibians, reptiles, plants, and aquatic invertebrates, but I have been gradually expanding my horizons into different taxa (big fan of woodpeckers these days). Outside of the classroom, I enjoy hiking, camping, climbing, and photographing salamanders and wildflowers.
