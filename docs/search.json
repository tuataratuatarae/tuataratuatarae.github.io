    "text": "My name is Nick Chang and I’m a senior in the Department of Environmental Sciences at Emory University! I am currently working on a project describing microhabitat use in the Talladega seal salamander (Desmognathus cheaha), a newly described species of plethodontid salamander. I am interested broadly in biogeography, spatial ecology, and shifts in habitat suitability resulting from anthropogenic change. While I am open to working in a diverse range of study systems, previous work has given me experience working in forested, freshwater, and coastal ecosystems, and I have a special interest in amphibians, reptiles, plants, and aquatic invertebrates.\nAs I complete my final year in undergrad, I am looking for opportunities for the future! I am planning on taking a year off before applying for graduate school (both MS and PhD programs), so if you are looking for graduate students or a LTE and have an opportunity please reach out! You can reach me at njchang@emory.edu.\n\nDesmognathus cheaha from DeKalb Co., GA"

    "text": "My name is Nick and I’m an undergrad studying Environmental Sciences at Emory University! I am broadly interested in ecology, biogeography and conservation biology, and while I am open to work in a variety of ecosystems, I have the most experience working in forests, freshwater streams, and coastal areas. I’m super stoked about amphibians, reptiles, plants, and aquatic invertebrates, but I have been gradually expanding my horizons into different taxa (big fan of woodpeckers these days). Though I have probably been on the ecology career trajectory since elementary school, I did make a few forays into the world of Latin and Roman history in middle/high school, and was nearly a Classics minor as an undergrad. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy hiking, camping, climbing, and photographing salamanders and wildflowers. I’ve also been making a lot of maps for fun lately. I have a 1400+ day streak on Duolingo and enjoy the NYT Mini Crossword. I’m also a huge fan of the KY-based band Bendigo Fletcher."
