Setosi). This group is distributed across the Great Lakes region, but there has been much debate over how many taxa actually occur in this group. Rubus are difficult to study due to the prevalence of hybridization, polyploidization, and apomixis across the evolutionary history of the genus.\nAs a part of my dissertation, I plan to assess patterns of population genomic structure for listed Rubus species in Minnesota and use niche modeling to assess climate vulnerability. I also aim to use morphological, genomic, and ecological approaches to offer an improved estimate of the number and distribution of species in this group. Finally, I’m hoping to use the evolution of Rubus subg. Rubus (which contains sect. Setosi) to ask questions about macroevolutionary patterns driving patterns of species rarity."

I performed respirometry trials on diploid, mated triploid, and chemically-induced triploid oysters that had been outplanted at various locations in the Puget Sound. I also collected environmental data from each site, and used titration and spectrophotometric pH measurements to characterize the carbonate chemistry systems of these areas, to determine the role of environmental variables in stress responses.\n\n\n\n\nFarmed Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), Puget Sound, WA"

As a part of this project, I participated in soil sampling efforts at participants’ homes within the Westside Atlanta Superfund Site boundary. I also led the processing and analysis of these samples using x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and managed the disposal of contaminated samples after analysis.\n\nDuring the summer of 2022, I participated in the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) program at Emory to analyze slag and sediment samples from streams in the metro-Atlanta area to identify areas of concern for heavy metal contamination.\n\n\n\nSouth River Headwaters, East Point, GA"

    "text": "Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior / University of Minnesota\nAdvisor: Dr. Ya Yang\nAs a graduate student at the University of Minnesota, I am studying the evolution, conservation genomics, and biogeography of a unique group of morphologically cryptic, peatland-associated wild blackberries (Rubus sect. Setosi). This group is distributed across the Great Lakes region, but there has been much debate over how many taxa actually occur in this group. Rubus are difficult to study due to the prevalence of hybridization, polyploidization, and apomixis across the evolutionary history of the genus.\nAs a part of my dissertation, I plan to assess patterns of population genomic structure for listed Rubus species in Minnesota and use niche modeling to assess climate vulnerability. I also aim to use morphological, genomic, and ecological approaches to offer an improved estimate of the number and distribution of species in this group. Finally, I’m hoping to use the evolution of Rubus subg. Rubus (which contains sect. Setosi) to ask questions about macroevolutionary patterns driving patterns of species rarity."

I am isolating DNA from plants in ABG’s conservation safeguarding collection and local herbaria, then using whole genome sequencing to study phylogenomic relationships in this species complex.\nIn addition to my phylogenomic work, I used ecological niche models to assess patterns of niche overlap and climate vulnerability in two imperiled, narrowly-sympatric montane Sarracenia.\n\n\n\nWherry’s Pitcher Plant (Sarracenia alabamensis ssp. wherryi).
