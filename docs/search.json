In this role, I am currently studying the conservation genetics of the Sarracenia rubra complex, a group of North American pitcher plants of conservation concern and unresolved taxonomic status.\nThis spring, I graduated from the Department of Environmental Sciences at Emory University, where I studied the microhabitat use of the Talladega seal salamander (Desmognathus cheaha), a newly split species of plethodontid salamander. I am interested broadly in biogeography, spatial ecology, and shifts in habitat suitability resulting from anthropogenic change.
