In addition, I am using both field and raster data to characterize streams and their watersheds, and to explore patterns in D. cheaha abundance, particularly along an urbanizing gradient.\nThis project is funded by a Lester Grant from Emory’s Department of Environmental Sciences.\n\n\n\nTalladega seal salamander (Desmognathus cheaha), DeKalb Co., GA"

I performed respirometry trials on diploid, mated triploid, and chemically-induced triploid oysters that had been outplanted at various locations in the Puget Sound. I also collected environmental data from each site, and used titration and spectrophotometric pH measurements to characterize the carbonate chemistry systems of these areas, to determine the role of environmental variables in stress responses.\n\nMy participation in this project was funded by a NOAA Ernest F. Hollings Scholarship.\n\n\n\nFarmed Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas), Puget Sound, WA"

As a part of this project, I participated in soil sampling efforts at participants’ homes within the Westside Atlanta Superfund Site boundary. I also led the processing and analysis of these samples using x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and managed the disposal of contaminated samples after analysis.\n\nDuring the summer of 2022, I participated in the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE)program at Emory to analyze slag and sediment samples from streams in the metro-Atlanta area to identify areas of concern for heavy metal contamination.\n\n\n\nSouth River Headwaters, East Point, GA"

I am currently working on a project describing microhabitat use in the Talladega seal salamander (Desmognathus cheaha), a newly described species of plethodontid salamander. I am interested broadly in biogeography, spatial ecology, and shifts in habitat suitability resulting from anthropogenic change. While I am open to working in a diverse range of study systems, previous work has given me experience working in forested, freshwater, and coastal ecosystems, and I have a special interest in amphibians, reptiles, plants, and aquatic invertebrates.\nAs I complete my final year in undergrad, I am looking for opportunities for the future! I am planning on taking a year off before applying for graduate school (both MS and PhD programs), so if you are looking for graduate students or a LTE and have an opportunity please reach out! You can reach me at njchang@emory.edu.\n\nAmbystoma maculatum from DeKalb Co., GA"
