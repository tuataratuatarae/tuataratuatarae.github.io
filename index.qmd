My name is Nick Chang and I'm currently an NSF Research & Mentoring for Post-baccalaureates (RaMP) trainee based at the Southeastern Center for Conservation at the Atlanta Botanical Garden! In this role, I am currently studying the conservation genetics of the *Sarracenia rubra* complex, a group of North American pitcher plants of conservation concern and unresolved taxonomic status. This spring, I graduated from the [Department of Environmental Sciences](envs.emory.edu) at Emory University, where I studied the microhabitat use of the Talladega seal salamander (*Desmognathus cheaha),* a newly split species of plethodontid salamander. I am interested broadly in biogeography, spatial ecology, and shifts in habitat suitability resulting from anthropogenic change. While I am open to working in a diverse range of study systems, previous work has given me experience working in forested, freshwater, and coastal ecosystems, and I have a special interest in amphibians, reptiles, plants, and aquatic invertebrates.
