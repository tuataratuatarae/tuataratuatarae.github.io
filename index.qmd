My name is Nick Chang and I'm a senior in the [Department of Environmental Sciences](envs.emory.edu) at Emory University! I am currently working on a project describing microhabitat use in the Talladega seal salamander (*Desmognathus cheaha),* a newly described species of plethodontid salamander. I am interested broadly in biogeography, spatial ecology, and shifts in habitat suitability resulting from anthropogenic change. While I am open to working in a diverse range of study systems, previous work has given me experience working in forested, freshwater, and coastal ecosystems, and I have a special interest in amphibians, reptiles, plants, and aquatic invertebrates.
