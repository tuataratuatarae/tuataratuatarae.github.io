My name is Nick Chang and I'm a senior in the [Department of Environmental Sciences](envs.emory.edu) at Emory University! I am currently working on a project describing microhabitat use in the Talladega seal salamander (*Desmognathus cheaha),* a newly described species of plethodontid salamander. I am interested broadly in biogeography, spatial ecology, and shifts in habitat suitability resulting from anthropogenic change. While I am open to working in a diverse range of study systems, previous work has given me experience working in forested, freshwater, and coastal ecosystems, and I have a special interest in amphibians, reptiles, plants, and aquatic invertebrates.

As I complete my final year in undergrad, I am looking for opportunities for the future! I am planning on taking a year off before applying for graduate school (both MS and PhD programs), so if you are looking for graduate students or a LTE and have an opportunity please reach out!
