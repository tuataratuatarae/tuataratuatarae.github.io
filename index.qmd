My name is Nick Chang and I'm currently an NSF Research & Mentoring for Post-baccalaureates (RaMP) trainee based at the [Southeastern Center for Conservation](https://atlantabg.org/conservation-research/southeastern-center-for-conservation/) at the Atlanta Botanical Garden. In this role, I am currently studying the phylogenomics and biogeography of the *Sarracenia rubra* complex, a group of North American pitcher plants of conservation concern and unresolved taxonomic status.

This fall, I will join the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior at the University of Minnesota to pursue my Ph.D. studying the conservation genetics of imperiled brambles (*Rubus sp.*).
